ðŸ’¡problem 1  
State-space method experiment. Once upon a time there was a river with m(=3) missionaries, m(=3) savages and a small boat with a maximum of n(=2) passengers on the left bank of the river. Make a covenant that there are either no missionaries on the left bank, no wildlings on the right bank and no more wildlings on the boat than there are missionaries, otherwise the wildlings will eat the missionaries. Search for a solution that will allow all the savages and missionaries to cross safely to the right bank.
Requirements:  
(1) Submit source code and executable files.  
(2) Submit a report on the experiment, including: a brief description of the code, screenshots of the results of the run and a description.  
(3) Extra credit: you can manually enter m,c,n and then output the process of crossing the river safely; if there is no solution for crossing the river safely, a hint is also given  

ðŸ’¡problem 2  
1. Implement the solution procedure for the A* algorithm using the 8-digit problem as an example (programming language is not limited) and design the estimation function.
Note: The estimation function must be described in the lab report and the corresponding code must be attached.  
2. Set the initial and target states, solve the problem for the valuation function, and output the move process.  
Requirements:  
(1) Submit source code and executable file.  
(2) Submit an experimental report including: a brief description of the code, screenshots of the running results and explanations, etc.

ðŸ’¡problem 3  
The Iris dataset was divided into a training set (Iris-train.txt) and a test set (Iris-test.txt), each containing 75 samples, with 25 samples for each flower in each set. For training purposes, the 3 types of flowers were numbered 1, 2 and 3 . Using these data, a neural network (4*10*3) with 4 inputs (corresponding to 4 features), an implicit layer (10 neurons) and 3 outputs (corresponding to the probability that the sample belongs to a particular species) was trained.
The network is trained using the training set, then the labels for each sample in the test set are predicted and the prediction accuracies are output (run 10 times independently, list the accuracies for the 10 times, and output the average accuracy and standard deviation).
Requirements:  
(1) Submit source code and executable file.  
(2) Submit an experimental report, including a brief description of the code, screenshots of the run results and explanations, etc.  
Note: In the experiment report, the learning rate in the gradient descent process should be specified and correspond to the corresponding source code.
